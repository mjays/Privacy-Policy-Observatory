# Privacy Policy Observatory

This place is intended to archive privacy policies of multiple web corporations and track their changes over time.

At some stage, it would be nice if we could translate those policies into plain English to make them understandable to the users of those services.

If you want to submit a privacy policy of a web service, please issue a pull request.
